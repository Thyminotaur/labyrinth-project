    "    This mobile robotics project is inspired form the old legend of <i>Theseus and the Labyrinth</i>. It all started during the SHS course <i>Myths of the ancient Mediterranean Sea</i> with the following question:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if the Minotaur, trapped forever in the huge Labyrinth built on Creta island, could find his way out and live his best life under the greek sun?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is therefore to help the little Thyminotaur to find his way out of the maze! To help him with his quest of freedom, the 5 following tools are implemented in the project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vision: Placed well above the maze, a camera detects the walls, maze's exits and the position of the robot. The optimal path is then computed with these vision information.\n",
    "2. Global Navigation: With the help of the camera, the global path to the nearest exit of the labyrinth is compiled and send as the route to follow for the Thymio.\n",
    "3. Local Navigation: With the help of the 5 front infrared sensors, the Thymio can avoid unexpected obstacles along the way, using inputs from a 5-neural network, each one associated to one sensor.\n",
    "4. Filtering: TO BE COMPLETED.\n",
    "5. Motion Control: Once the path is computed, the information is transmitted to the Thymio which starts moving.\n",

    "1. The Thymio is placed on a random cell of the labyrinth. The camera detects the *ArUco Marker* on the Thymio, compilling its position and orientation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The labyrinth is drawn with 2 exits; using the Dijkstra’s algorithm, the Thymio follows the path to the nearest exit of the maze (green path on the image).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As the robot almost reaches the exit, a mysterious old greek god closes the wall in front of the poor Thyminotaur! Using the global vision, a new path is computed and the robot turns to follow this new route (orange path on the image).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. During the path following, some unexpected obstacles will block the road to our adventurous Thyminotaur. Thanks to his local avoidance abilities (based on his proximity sensors/neural network architecture combination), no unexpected event will stand between him and the exit. He bypasses every obstacles until the end of his journey.\n",

    "The labyrinth covers a 4x5 cells unit (17cm x 20cm each) and is printed on a A0 white paper (shout-out to the PolyRepro for their fast delivery). To ensure a good camera tracking, the Thymio carries an <i> ArUco Marker</i>, which allows to detect the position and orientation of the robot. The marker is stick to <i>Lego bricks</i> and mounted directly on top of the Thymio, as you can see on the picture below.</p>\n",

    "1. At first, a solid labyrinth made of wood was considered to enclose the Thymio. After several tries and prototypes, the full paper option (black lines printed on a large white sheet) was selected for its practicality and easiness of implementation with the vision part.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. To mark out the available space of the Thymio (his playground), 4 additionnal arUco Markers are placed on each corner of the sheet. The camera placed above the labyrinth is never perfectly aligned with the sheet, both in position and angle; the arUcodes allow a straightforward flattening of the image at the vision initialization."

    "In the Thyminotaur project, the whole vision data is provided by a single, static camera located over the robot's scope of operation. We use vision during the initialization phase (labyrinth recognition, full-scale calibration, corners detection) and while the robot is moving (path computation, exit and thymio detection). The entire vision part is coded using the Python library <i>Open Source Computer Vision</i>, or [open cv][cv2] in short.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assignated arUco Markers to every critical variables of the project (the moving Thymio, the 4 corners, the 2 possible exits) to ensure consistency in the code. These markers are a simple yet efficent way to convert information from a full vision scope to a code of variables and raw data (images on left & center). For corners, it is just a way to fix the oprating frame of the robot. On the Thymio, the marker allows us to track the position and angle of the Thyminotaur, from the strating point in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labyrinth is made of large, 20mm-width black lines printed of white paper to achieve the best contrast. This simplifies the task of our programm when it comes to define the possible paths for the robot (image on right). Since system vision is a key element in both the global avoidance algorithme as well as for general system motion control, we directly included the appropriate vision functions in each class rather than putting them in their own seperate class. <br>\n",
